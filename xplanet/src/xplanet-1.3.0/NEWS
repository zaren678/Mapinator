This file is aimed at those who are upgrading from versions of Xplanet
earlier than 1.0.

Xplanet 1.0 is a completely rewritten program from the older (0.95)
version.  I should have called it Xplanet2 to avoid confusion, but I
didn't think of it, and I apologize for any trouble.  

The default behaviour of Xplanet is run continuously instead of just
once. As a result, the "xplanetbg" program is no longer needed.

Xplanet in its default mode will now draw multiple bodies.  For
example, when drawing Jupiter, any of the Galilean satellites in the
field of view will also be drawn.  For this reason, options that are
specific to a body, such as the image map or marker files, are now
specified in a configuration file.  Options that affect the way the
image is drawn, such as geometry or label, are still specified on the
command line.

There is a [default] section at the top of the configuration file.  Be
careful to specify options that apply to only one planet under that
planet's section, and not under [default].  For example, a common
mistake is to put cloud_map=clouds.jpg under [default] and not under
[earth].  This will overlay clouds on every planet which is probably
not what you want, and is a huge waste of time!

Input image dimensions should be powers of 2, where the height is half
the width (e.g. 2048x1024).  Other image dimensions will work, but
performance will be slower.  Input images are specified in the
configuration file.

Marker files must now be in UTF-8 encoding.  Font files must now be
TrueType fonts.

The subdirectories under share/xplanet (e.g. arcs, markers,
satellites) each contain README and example files for more
information.

Command line argument changes:

The following command line options should instead be set as parameters in
the file specified with the '-config' option or the file "config/default"
in the '-searchdir' directory.
