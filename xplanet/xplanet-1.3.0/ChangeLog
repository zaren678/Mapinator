Version 1.3.0 (released 18 Feb 2012)
	* add "outlined" keyword to marker files

	* update JPL ephemeris code for 64 bit machines

	* add bump_shade config file parameter

	* add opacity keyword for markers

	* implement Rayleigh scattering

Version 1.2.1 (released 18 Apr 2009)

	* Remove signbit() from ProjectionIcosagnomonic.cpp

	* Add shadows from satellites on Saturn's rings, let brightness of
	rings go to zero as Saturn approaches equinox.
	
	* Add trail_output option to satellite files to print out
	satellite positions.
	
	* Calculate eclipse shadows a little past the terminator so they
	don't get cut off sharply.

	* Reload satellite files in case TLE files are updated between
	renderings.  Suggested by Lutz Mändle.
	
	* Added Lambert Equal Area projection

	* Check that -origin above or below is not specified for the Sun.

	* Added a definition for signbit() in ProjectionIcosagnomonic.cpp

	* Add patch from Doug Hawkins to support marker_* keywords in
	config file.

	* Added the -label_body option.  This is useful in conjunction
	with -separation to specify which body the label should apply to.

	* Added the -separation option.  This places the observer at a
	point in space where two bodies have the specified separation.

	* Allow -glare 0 to remove sun glare.

	* Fixed a bug where arcs were sometimes not drawn if they were
	vertical or horizontal lines.

	* A thickness value may now be specified for arcs.

	* Added max_radius and min_radius keywords to marker files.  This
	disables drawing of the marker if the planet radius is larger than
	or smaller than the specified value, respectively.

	* Fixed a bug where the arc color was not reset to the default
	color for subsequent arcs in the file.

Version 1.2.0 (released 16 Jun 2005)

	* Added the -grs_longitude option, to specify the longitude of
	Jupiter's Great Red Spot, in System II coordinates.  This assumes
	the Jupiter image has the center of the Great Red Spot at pixel 0
	(at the left side of the image) in order to draw it at the right
	position.

	* Added the Icosagnomonic projection, contributed by Ian Turner.
	
	* Fixed a bug where output filenames had an extra digit in some
	cases. 

	* Added the bump_map and bump_scale options in the configuration
	file. 

	* Added the -glare option to set the size of the sun's glare.

	* An image map may be specified for the sun in the configuration
	file now.  A shade value is now required for the sun (should be
	100, otherwise the sun will have a night side!)
	
	* Added the -arc_spacing option to set the default angular
	distance between great arc points.  It used to be 0.1 degree, so
	arcs smaller than this wouldn't get drawn.

        * Fixed a bug where markers were not aligned properly when using
	align = "above" or "below".

	* Added warnings if options are specified in the [default] section
	of the configuration file that probably shouldn't be there.

Version 1.1.2 (released 5 Dec 2004)

        * Saturn's rings are now drawn properly when using "magnify" in
        the config file.

        * Added marker_fontsize as an option in the configuration file.

        * Added the Bonne, Gnomonic, Polyconic, and Tangential Spherical
        Cube (TSC) projections.

        * Added the -proj_param option.  Note that the -projection option
	cannot be abbreviated to -proj anymore!

        * Color cloud maps are now allowed.

        * A color may now be specified with -background.

Version 1.1.1 (released 23 Jul 2004)

        * Added -north path, -target path, and -path_relative_to options.

        * Added -output_start_index option.

        * Print a list of compile-time options when using the -version
        option.

        * Fixed a bug where orbits were not drawn for bodies using SPICE
        kernels.

        * Added ssec_map option to configuration files to use University
        of Wisconsin cloud maps.

Version 1.1.0 (released 20 Jun 2004)

        * Added the -fork option.

        * Fixed a bug where stars were not drawn when using the -proj
        option. 

Version 1.0.8 (released 23 May 2004)

        * Fixed a bug where eclipse shadows were not drawn properly. 

        * Timer now sleeps until it's time to wake up, instead
        of sleeping for a set time.

Version 1.0.7 (released 04 May 2004)

        * The native Quicktime library can be used when reading/writing
        image files on Mac OS X.

        * The -hibernate and -idlewait options now work on Mac OS X.

        * Fixed a segfault when writing image files.

        * Minor updates to allow compilation with gcc 3.4.0.

Version 1.0.6 (released 21 Apr 2004)

        * Fixed a bug where markers on the far side of a planet were being
        drawn when they shouldn't have been.
        
        * Fixed a bug where satellites were not drawn for some locales.
        
        * Added -projection random.  This picks a random projection.

Version 1.0.5 (released 23 Mar 2004)

        * Improved locale support. The date string is now converted to
        UTF-8 using iconv() after being created by strftime() in the
        default encoding.  Added the "lang" keyword to marker files.

        * Floating point numbers in all input files must be in the "C"
        locale format, meaning that the decimal separator must be the '.'
        character and not the ','.

        * Fixed align=center option in marker files.
        
Version 1.0.4 (released 05 Mar 2004)

        * Added support for SPICE kernels for spacecraft ephemerides.

        * Xplanet now works without freetype.  There will be no text
        annotation, but it will run instead of exit immediately.

Version 1.0.3 (released 06 Jan 2004)

        * Jupiter and Saturn are now drawn as oblate spheroids.

Version 1.0.2 (released 22 Dec 2003)

        * Added -interpolate_origin_file option so that origin_files may
        be used as ephemeris files.

        * Added -label_string option to set the first line of the label. 

        * Added the Lambert (Cylindrical Equal Area) projection.

        * The -geometry option now applies to the root window.  The area
        outside the image is black.

        * The format for the star map is different.  It is now Dec, RA,
        Mag to be consistent with marker and arc files, which have lat
        then lon.

        * -marker_file and -arc_file can now be used on the command line.
        Coordinates for these files are Declination and Right Ascension.
        Markers and arcs are plotted against the star field.

        * Fixed a text rendering bug where the text wasn't positioned
        properly.
        
        * Added -dynamic_origin option to read a file for the observer's
        position before each rendering.

        * Changed --disable-screensaver to --with-xscreensaver in
        configure script.
        
        * -origin and -range options can now be used together.

        * Added -save_desktop_file option for Windows and OS X.

        * Added twilight option in config file to adjust extent of
        terminator.

        * -localtime option wasn't right for most planets.

        * Added -ephemeris_file option.  This allows the use of JPL's
        DExxx files for super-duper accuracy.

        * Added pango support.  The workings of pango are still mysterious
        to me so there may be things that don't quite look right.  There
        are memory leaks inside the pango library, so using this option
        all of the time is not a good idea.
        
Version 1.0.1 (released 17 Mar 2003)

        * mapbounds is now supported as an option in the configuration
        file. 

        * Xplanet now works natively on Aqua, but is a little flaky; it
        sometimes fails to set the desktop and the default "Aqua Blue"
        shows up.  Reproducible bug reports are greatly appreciated!

        * The timer would cause an exit after one drawing on non-X11
        systems. 

        * Markers on the other planets were not drawn properly with the
        -projection option.

Version 1.0.0 (released 11 Mar 2003)

        * First public release.  See the NEWS file for changes from the
        previous version.
